## Establishing the Analogy
Your client.py acts as a central Concierge Desk that manages highly specialized Experts (the servers) and a powerful Senior Concierge (the LLM/Agent) to process customer requests.

**Phase 1: Setup and Initialization (Opening the Office)**
`This phase establishes the foundational structure and loads all necessary resources.`

| Load .env (Check Vault) |

        ↓
        
| Path Setup (Map Locations) |

        ↓
        
| MultiServerMCPClient Instantiation (HR & Logistics Dept) |

        ↓
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|  Setup Math Expert (stdio Line)   | Setup Weather Expert (stdio Line) |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
                 ↓ (Client manages both subprocesses)
        | client.get_tools() (Compile Master Service Catalog) |
                         ↓
        | Load LLM (Seat the Senior Concierge / The Brain) |
                         ↓
        | create_react_agent (Hand over the SOP / Rulebook) |

**Phase 2: Execution and Testing (Processing a Customer Request)**
`This phase shows how the agent uses the tools to answer a complex request (e.g., the weather query).`

| run_agent_test() Invoked (Quality Control Checker) |
                       ↓
| User Query: "What is the weather...?" (Customer Request) |
                       ↓
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Agent/LLM (Senior Concierge) makes a DECISION:            |
| "I need the 'get_weather' tool."                          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
                       ↓
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Tool Call formulated (Formal Request sent)                |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
                       ↓
| MCP Client (Logistics) intercepts the call & Proxies it |
                       ↓
| Internal Communication via **stdio Phone Line** to Weather Expert |
                       ↓
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Weather Server (Expert) Execution:                        |
| 1. Receives request.                                      |
| 2. Makes External API Call (OpenWeatherMap).              |
| 3. Gets data (29.81°C).                                   |
| 4. Returns result via **stdio Phone Line**.               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
                       ↓
| Agent receives Tool Result |
                       ↓
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Agent/LLM (Senior Concierge) formulates FINAL ANSWER      |
| "The current weather in Mirpur Khas... is 29.81°C."       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
                       ↓
| Print Final Response (Final Report) |
                       ↓
| End of Script (Office Manager calls for cleanup/shutdown) |
